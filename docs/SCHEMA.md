### continuous_contracts
Table for storing generated continuous futures contracts.

```sql
CREATE TABLE continuous_contracts (
    date TIMESTAMP,
    symbol VARCHAR,  -- e.g., VXc1, VXc2 for first and second VX continuous contracts
    open DOUBLE,
    high DOUBLE,
    low DOUBLE,
    close DOUBLE,
    volume BIGINT,
    source VARCHAR DEFAULT 'continuous',
    interval_value INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    interval_unit VARCHAR DEFAULT 'day',
    adjusted BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    quality INTEGER DEFAULT 100
)
```

The continuous_contracts table stores generated continuous futures contracts with the following features:
- Continuous contract symbols are formed as {root_symbol}c{n} where n is the contract number (e.g., VXc1, VXc2)
- Data is rolled over to the next contract ON the expiry date of the current contract
- Gaps in data are preserved when underlying contract data is missing
- Only daily data is stored (interval_value=1, interval_unit='day')
- Source is always set to 'continuous' to distinguish from raw contract data
- Quality is set to 100 for all continuous contract data points

Example usage:
```sql
-- Query the first continuous contract for VX
SELECT date, open, high, low, close, volume
FROM continuous_contracts
WHERE symbol = 'VXc1'
ORDER BY date;

-- Compare first and second continuous contracts
SELECT c1.date, 
       c1.close as c1_close,
       c2.close as c2_close,
       c2.close - c1.close as spread
FROM continuous_contracts c1
JOIN continuous_contracts c2 ON c1.date = c2.date
WHERE c1.symbol = 'VXc1'
  AND c2.symbol = 'VXc2'
ORDER BY c1.date;
```

The complete SQL implementation for all tables, views, and indexes can be found in the `init_schema.sql` file, which should be used for initializing the database in Claude Code.

## Key Features

### Continuous Contracts
- Multiple continuous contracts can be maintained for the same base symbol (e.g., VXc1, VXc2)
- Contracts are generated with proper rollover handling on expiry days
- Data quality and adjustment metadata is preserved
- Supports various futures contracts including VX (CBOE Volatility Index Futures)

### Data Quality
- Quality field (0-100) indicates data reliability
- Source tracking for all data points
- Adjustment flags for modified data

### Time Management
- All timestamps stored in UTC
- Supports multiple time intervals (1-minute, 5-minute, daily, etc.)
- Proper handling of market holidays and rollovers

## Common Operations

### Generating Continuous Contracts
```sql
-- Example: Generate VX continuous contracts
INSERT INTO continuous_contracts
SELECT 
    date,
    'VXc1' as symbol,
    open,
    high,
    low,
    close,
    volume,
    'continuous' as source,
    1 as interval_value,
    'day' as interval_unit,
    true as adjusted,
    100 as quality
FROM daily_bars
WHERE symbol LIKE 'VX%'
AND date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY date;
```

### Querying Continuous Contracts
```sql
-- Get latest data for a continuous contract
SELECT * FROM continuous_contracts
WHERE symbol = 'VXc1'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Checking Data Coverage
```sql
-- Check data availability for continuous contracts
SELECT 
    symbol,
    MIN(date) as earliest_date,
    MAX(date) as latest_date,
    COUNT(*) as records
FROM continuous_contracts
WHERE symbol LIKE 'VX%'
GROUP BY symbol
ORDER BY symbol;
```

1. The `market_data` table serves as the source of truth for all market data.
2. Views like `daily_bars` provide convenient access to filtered data.
3. The `continuous_contracts` table stores derived data generated from raw market data.
4. Multiple continuous contracts can be maintained simultaneously for analysis.
5. All timestamps are stored in UTC to avoid timezone issues.
6. Data quality and source tracking are maintained throughout the system.
7. Proper rollover handling is implemented for futures contracts.
