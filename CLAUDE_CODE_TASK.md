# Claude Code Task

I need you to help me build a financial data management system based on the specifications in this repository.

## Project Overview
This project implements a system to retrieve financial market data from TradeStation APIs, economic data from various sources, and additional data through web scraping. It uses DuckDB for storage and follows the single-file agents pattern.

## Task Priority
1. First, analyze the project structure and requirements in PROJECT_SPEC.md
2. Implement the DuckDB schema as specified in SCHEMA.md and sql/init_schema.sql
3. Create the TradeStation API agent based on the template in templates/agent_template.py
4. Implement additional agents as needed

## Additional Notes
- Focus on creating modular, reusable components
- Follow the single-file agents pattern
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Document all code thoroughly

Please start by analyzing the project requirements and then proceed with implementation.
